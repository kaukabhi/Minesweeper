# Minesweeper

Implemented Minesweeper game without a graphical interface.

Steps to run the game:

I have created Minesweeper.java class. Run it and it will ask you to enter the grid size, mines, row and column on every play.

Rules to play:

1. Create a board of size n * n tiles.
2. Enter the number of mines to place on the board randomly.
3. Enter valid row number and column number (0 based index).
4. If you step on a mine, it's game over and all the mines are revealed.
5. You can win by not stepping on any mine and reveal all the safe tiles.
